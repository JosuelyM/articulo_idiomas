	Reviewer 1: The manuscript “Statistical analysis of word flow among
five Indo-European languages” presents an approach to describe how
words have flowed from one language to another over the course of at
least a century. They use data from Google Books N-gram to describe
these transitions. It is an interesting topic but I feel that there
are some severe limitations in calling this a statistical analysis and
the conclusions that come from it.

	\begin{enumerate}
		
		\item The abstract does not adequately describe what the reader will find
		in the paper. The title and abstract both make it sound like there
		will be statistical methods and results to discuss, yet there is not a
		true use of statistical analyses to be found in this manuscript.
		
		\item \textbf{HECHO} On page 2 it is stated that there are two “models” used to quantify
		the influence of one language on another. However, these are not
		statistical models that are being used. They are simply two different
		transformations of the data. “Approaches” is a better word than
		“model” although there are other words that would also be suitable,
		but model is not a suitable word to describe what is being done.
		
		
		\item \textbf{Hecho, se manipulo el parrafo para cambiar la palabra statistical y no perder la idea del parrafo} Later in that same paragraph, after describing the “models” being
		used, there is a statement “…that are responsible for the flow of
		words.” This sounds like a statement of causal inference. However, all
		that can really be said is that various things have been identified
		that might be related to the flow of words. There is no causal pattern
		or analysis within this manuscript.
		
		\item  At the end of the introduction is the following sentence. “Our work
		is of a statistical nature, and as such, has its limitations.” I did
		not find a statistical analysis in the manuscript so saying that this
		manuscript is of a statistical nature is not accurate. There are data
		descriptions throughout the manuscript, and some transformations of
		the data, but there are no statistical analyses to describe the
		patterns or possible relationships.
		
		\item \textbf{HECHO}  In the first paragraph of Methodology I would make the following
		change. “We removed certain words that did not contributed to the
		analysis:” to “We removed the following types of words:”
		
		\item  \textbf{HECHO} There is a description of data cleaning and then the following
		sentence. “From this dataset, and after cleaning the data,…” This
		makes it sound like there was additional data cleaning in addition to
		just removing certain types of words. This should be more specific in
		what is meant by data cleaning.
		
		\item At the end of Methodology is a paragraph with some concluding
		remarks on the errors. It would be helpful to know how many errors
		like these were found and what proportion of the full dataset
		consisted of such errors. Also, I agree that it would be helpful to
		have included experts in each language that is being included in this
		analysis.
		
		\item Below Figure 1 on page 3 is the sentence “Thus, it could be said
		that the second most influential language among the five studies has
		been Italian.” Is there a statistical measure or test that can be
		pointed towards as validation for this statement?
		
		\item The very last sentence of New Words reads “…within statistical
		fluctuations, an asymptotic power law decay with an exponent close to
		one.” What is meant by statistical fluctuations? That infers that
		there was a statistical model with a measure of variance. Was there a
		statistical model fit with these curves to evaluate the fit of a
		power-law decay?
		
		\item  In Accumulated Words is formula 1. The description of the formula
		describes using both frequencies and ranks and it is not clear how
		both are involved in the calculation. Also in formula 1, it is not
		clear how j and k differ. What does j range to since U(t) is not
		indexed by j so there are multiple j values being summed. How does j
		relate to k?
		
		\item In the English section under Accumulated Words it states that “the
		use of English in French and Spanish has increased steadily in the
		last century whereas in Italian, it has maintained a constant level.”
		This is an observational description of trends seen in the data and
		there is not a statistical model and analysis to evaluate if trends
		are constant or increasing at some rate. It would be nice to include
		those trend rates. The same is true for the French, German, Italian,
		and Spanish sections.
		
		\item Under Rank Diversity, why not just use the counts rather than this
		Rank Diversity measure. It seems that the figures shown of Rank
		Diversity could also be shown using the actual counts. Since the
		actual counts are simpler to understand, then it would be easier to
		describe the results. If the Rank Diversity does add a detail and
		interpretation that is not feasible by using the counts, then this
		justification should be included.
		
		\item  In Figure 5 and equation 2, the year is changed to log base 10.
		Please explain the rationale for this and make it clear to the reader
		that this is being done and why it is being done.
		
		\item  In Figure 5 and equation 2, were any other functions considered
		besides the cumulative Gaussian function? There are other sigmoid
		shapes that could be used so why was this one chosen? Also, what is
		meant by mu and sigma were obtained with a linear regression. This is
		a nonlinear function so it would be nonlinear regression to estimate
		those parameters and were they estimated using nonlinear least squares
		or maximum likelihood or something else? Then for the results of this,
		why can that conclusion of migrant accumulated words in the middle and
		high ranks are the ones that tend to change their position. How
		exactly was this determined because it is not obvious from the
		equation or from the figure.
		
		\item  Although Google Books N-gram data are available for download, the
		specific cleaned data used in this analysis should be made available.
